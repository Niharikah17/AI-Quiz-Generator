Project Title: AI Quiz Generator<br>
Subtitle: An Intelligent Multi-Modal Assessment and Automated Grading Ecosystem

Project Overview
Cognify AI is a state-of-the-art educational technology platform designed to automate and enhance the academic evaluation process. Unlike traditional testing software, Cognify AI leverages artificial intelligence to bridge the gap between objective (Multiple Choice Questions) and subjective (Descriptive/Handwritten) assessments. The system provides a seamless end-to-end workflow—from secure user authentication and dynamic test configuration to AI-powered grading and strategic performance analytics.

Key Features
Secure Authentication Layer: A robust login interface that ensures data integrity and restricts access to authorized participants.

Dual-Modality Testing:

Objective (MCQ) Module: Supports dynamic test creation with customizable categories, difficulty levels, and integrated countdown timers for real-time monitoring.

Subjective (Descriptive) Module: A specialized interface where users can view complex questions and upload handwritten answers for evaluation.

AI-Driven Grading Engine: * Automated Scoring: Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to grade descriptive text.

Handwritten Recognition: Employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to digitize and evaluate manual submissions.

Strategic Performance Analytics: Instead of just a final score, the system provides a "Performance Review" that offers qualitative feedback, identifying specific conceptual gaps and providing actionable insights for student improvement.

Administrative Configuration: An intuitive setup phase for educators to define test parameters, including duration, subject matter, and evaluation rubrics.

Technical Objectives
Efficiency: To drastically reduce the turnaround time for grading descriptive papers, which is traditionally a manual, time-consuming process.

Consistency: To eliminate human bias in subjective grading by applying a standardized AI rubric across all submissions.

Insight: To transform raw data into "Strategic Analysis," helping learners focus on their "missing concepts" rather than just their final marks.

Target Audience
Educational Institutions: Schools and universities looking to automate large-scale examinations.

Competitive Exam Aspirants: Students needing instant, high-quality feedback on descriptive writing (e.g., UPSC or professional certifications).

Corporate Training: Businesses conducting skill assessments for employee upskilling.
